        <h3>Some nicely served sarmas</h3>
        <p>An absolute favorite of all generations which happily gathers us around the table during cold, winter months. These<br> 
        sauerkraut cabbage rolls, which successfully combine sweet, spicy, savory, and sour flavors, are like a family hug,<br>
        real comfort food in the Balkans way.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>For cabbage rolls</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole sour cabbage head (cca 1,8 kg)</li>
            <li>850 g ground meat (beef + pork)</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>60 g white rice</li>
            <li>35 g bread crumbs</li>
            <li>12 g salt</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon sweet paprika powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon hot paprika powder</li>
            <li>lard</li>
            <li>smaller piece of smoked meat (smoked dry pork ribs, smoked bacon etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For the roux</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1,5 tablespoon lard</li>
            <li>1,5-2 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon hot paprika powder (you can put less or more, depending on how spicy it is)</li>
            <li>salt (quantity of salt depends on how salty are the cabbage and dried meat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully separate the fermented cabbage leave. Depending on how small or big cabbage rolls you want to make,<br> 
                you will need about 15-20 cabbage leaves + some extra shredded leaves for covering the bottom of the cooking pot.<br> 
                If the cabbage is very sour and/or salty, wash the leaves briefly under cold water. After that, if you notice that<br> 
                cabbage leaves have pronounced hardy veins, remove them with a sharp knife. Repeat this step with all the leaves.</li>
            <li>Prepare a bigger cooking pot by coating the bottom with a thin layer of lard. Chopp roughly the leftover and torn<br> 
                cabbage leaves that won't be used for making the rolls and spread them on the bottom of the cooking pot. This step<br> 
                will prevent the sarma from burning during the cooking.</li>
            <li>Mince the onion and garlic and add to a bowl with ground meat, rice, eggs, bread crumbs, salt, black pepper, and<br> 
                sweet and hot paprika powder. Mix everything well using your hand. Take a piece of the meat stuffing, place it on<br> 
                the bottom part of the cabbage leaf and wrap it tightly in a roll. Repeat this with the rest of the stuffing and<br> 
                cabbage leaves.</li>
            <li>When you finish rolling up all of your sarma rolls, layer them tightly next to each other seam-side down in the<br> 
                cooking pot. Add a piece of dried meat (if using) take 2-3 additional cabbage leaves and cover the rolls. Put some<br> 
                load on it, like a smaller lid or an old ceramic plate, which will prevent the sarma rolls unroll during the cooking.<br> 
                Pour over the water so that the sarma is completely covered with it and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and let it cook for at least 2-2.5 hours, adding more water if necessary.</li>
            <li>When sarma is cooked, make your roux. In a small saucepan add lard and let it melt. Stir the flour with a whisk or<br> 
                wooden spoon for a few minutes over low heat. When the roux gets a light golden color, turn off the heat and stir in<br> 
                sweet and hot paprika powder. If necessary, you can add some salt too. Add the roux to the sarma and let it simmer for<br> 
                about 10 minutes. Serve with homemade bread or mashed potatoes.</li>
        </ol>
