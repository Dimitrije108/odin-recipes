Project "Recipes" is a basic recipe website built using HTML.

This is my first ever project and a first HTML project combining knowledge learnt during OTP's HTML Foundations course.

I took the following steps:
1. created index.html file, wrote a boilerplate;
2. created 3 other html pages inside the recipes folder for 3 different recipes;
3. linked all 3 pages to the main index.html;
4. provided content for my 3 recipe pages, including: heading, an image, another heading and description paragraphs, unordered ingredients list and ordered steps list;
5. worked with git using console and commands for staging, commiting, writing commit messages and eventually pushing my code to GitHub repo.
